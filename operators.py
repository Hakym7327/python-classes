# fav_color = input('Enter your favorite color: ')
# print(f'Your favorite color is {fav_color}')


# from datetime import datetime

# current_year = datetime.today().year

# age = input('How old are you?: ')
# birth_year = current_year - int(age)
# print(f'You were born in {birth_year}')
# INPUT FUNCTION ALWAYS RETURNS A STRING SO CONVERT TO INT
# VARIABLES IN UPPERCASE MAKES THEM A CONSTANT

# Write a Python program named `sum_of_two_digits.py` that takes a string as input from the user. The string will consist of exactly two digits (e.g., "23", "98", "09"). Your program should calculate and output the sum of these two digits.
# Example:
# For input "23", the program should output 5 i.e. (2 + 3).
# For input "98", the program should output 17 i.e. (9 + 8).
# For input "09", the program should output 9 i.e. (0 + 9).
# Assume that the input will always be a string made up of
# exactly two digits.

# digits = input('Enter two digits: ')
# first_digit = int(digits[0])
# second_digit =int(digits[1])
# sum_of_digits = first_digit + second_digit
# print(f'The sum of the digits is {sum_of_digits}')
